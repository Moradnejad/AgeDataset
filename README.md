 # Introduction
 
 We developed a five-step method and inferred birth and death years, binary gender, and occupation from community-submitted data to all language versions of the Wikipedia project. The dataset is the largest on notable deceased people and includes individuals from a variety of social groups, including but not limited to 107k females, 124 non-binary people, and 90k researchers, who are spread across more than 300 contemporary or historical regions.
